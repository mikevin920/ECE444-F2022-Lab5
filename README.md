## Pros and Cons of TDD
Test-driven development is the process of writing unit tests first before writing actual codes of the software, as compared to the process of finishing the software then writing up tests. Here are some pros and cons of TDD.
####Pros:
1. Easier teamwork - Team members may rapidly comprehend one other's code and make changes knowing that errors will be found in unit testing.
2. Simple maintenance - it is easy to discover errors from modification of the code since the unit test was already written.
3. Modular codebase - The code must be sufficiently modular to allow for comprehensive testing of each feature before writing small unit tests one at a time.
4. Clearly defined requirements - Before beginning development, writing unit tests forces the team to have clearly defined product requirements and use cases in.
 
#### Cons
1. Difficulty of learning - In order to write unit tests directly from requirements there is a learning curve for developers to start writing unit tests efficiently 
2. Tests must be maintained - The tests must be constantly updated in order to keep the codebase working.
3. Slower development - Because TDD puts more emphasis on defining and creating tests, it slows down initial development.
